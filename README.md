Lab 9: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio
By: Bianca Capretta
Date: 4/26/17

1. What is the purpose of this Git respository?
The purpose of this respository is to represent a compilation all of my large, 
independent projects from the entire semester in comp20.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I think I liked Assignment 2 the best. First, it was really interesting to actually
have the power to use Google Maps' API. Second, I liked how visual my work became.
With icons for vehicles and passengers, you could see where everyone was on a map.
My favorite lab was the one where we had to include lyrics to Rihanna's failed performance.
One, I liked working with embedded video and I also thought it was cool that we
could sync up with the timing to add lyrics below and "help" her out.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I came in knowing HTML and some Javascript, but realized I knew very few specifics.
I learned how it's important to separate content from style. I learned how to
use Node.js. I learned the web basics of how entering a URL works - a GET
request (and learned about POST request too)! Understanding client and server
side was also a big step in my growth in this class. 
Personally, I think the more I learn, the more I've grown. I learned a lot about
the web and formatting by executing the assignments in the class, and through that,
I believe I have expanded a rather significant chunk of my current CS knowledge.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Give 2 examples.
While we only dipped our toes into this topic, I learned to never ever trust 
user input! This last assignment made me realize how easy it could be to
hack in and cross-site script. Also mentioned above, I learned that you must
separate content from style. Not only does it separate/organize the html from the css,
it allows you to use the css file on many different html files.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Ah gosh, this question is a hard one. Comp20 was only my fourth real CS class 
(along with comp40 this semester) so I'm still figuring out exactly what interests
me. I did find the security section pretty interesting! That also made me want to figure
out how to make the most secure website. I'd love to learn more programming languages
and why they are built the way they are. Good thing I'm taking comp105 next fall!

Thank you for a wonderful semester!
