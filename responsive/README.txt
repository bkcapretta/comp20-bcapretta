1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what 
have not.

I have implemented an index.html file which has code that I simply copied and 
pasted in (no edits!). I then implemented a responsive.css file which shows the 
appropriate box in the ralphy.gif depending on screen width.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

I collaborated with my friends Jordan Bacher and Minal Mirpuri on this project. 
Jordan reminded me that you need to put px on both the width and height 
positions. Minal showed me a good website that explained sprites well.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

~2 hours
