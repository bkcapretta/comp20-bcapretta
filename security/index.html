		<h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side</h1>

		<hr><h2>Introduction</2>
			<p>For our last two assignments in comp20, we were tasked with essentially simulating an Uber-style product with a client and server-side that keeps track of passengers and vehicles. I, and all of my peers in this course, completed these assignments; now I am tasked to find three security vulnerabilities in Kingsley Bowen’s code.</p>

		<hr><h2>Methodology</h2>
			<p>When looking at his application, I decided to use Postman to simulate curl requests and attempt cross-site scripting. I learned Python to write a simple function and created a simple server to attack his website. I also inputted different points (latitudes and longitudes) into Assignment 2 to check the map’s representation of these points. I attempted to use Burp Suite to find more vulnerabilities but the application wouldn’t take his index.js because the JSON wasn’t in the right form.</p>

		<hr><h2>Abstract of Findings</2>
			<p>I identified three security flaws with Kingsley’s code. I first noticed that his code didn’t protect against outside code. It is possible to send in code to manipulate his webpage, such as creating a pop-up, redirecting the page, or changing the HTML. The second vulnerability is that there is no limit as to how many requests can be made to the page; so an attacker could potentially take up all the space on the database. The third issue includes no range check on the latitudes and longitudes sent in; so any numbers can be accepted through the server-side but won’t show up as a proper point on the map on the client-side.</p>

		<hr><h2>Issues Found</2>
			
			<h3><b>Issue 1</b></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Issue:</u> Cross-Site Scripting: Page Redirection. I was able to send a script through the username when using curl.</li>

				<li><u>Location:</u> Posting on https://gentle-sands-25039.herokuapp.com/submit</li>

				<li><u>Severity of Issue:</u> High - a user will never be able to access the website and will always be redirected to a joke website. A hacker could also redirect the victim to web content controlled by the attacker which would be bad news if private information were captured. Also, because this is a persistent attack, it will always be in the database when you want to go to the URL (at least, until the client clears their server).</li>

				<li><u>Description of Issue:</u> I noticed he didn’t check the username value in any way which meant I could send a script in the key-value. <img src="images/redirect3" alt="kinglsey's code">Using curl, I made a post request where I sent a script to in the username to redirect the page to jokes.cc.com. <img src="images/redirect2" alt="postman curl request"> </li>

				<li><u>Proof of Vulnerability:</u> <img src="images/redirect1" alt="joke page"></li>

				<li><u>Resolution:</u> You never want untrusted data in the HTML input, so one way to avoid cross-site scripting is to remove characters like < or > with something else. For example:</li>
			</ul>

			<xmp>html = html.replace(/</g, “&lt;”).replace(/>/g, “&gt;”);</xmp>
			<p>or</p>
			<xmp>function (html) {
				return $( $.parseHTML(html) ).text();  
			}</xmp>


			<h3><b>Issue 2</b></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Issue:</u> Rate limiting doesn’t exist. Can send as many post requests as I want.</li>

				<li><u>Location:</u> Posting on https://gentle-sands-25039.herokuapp.com/submit</li>

				<li><u>Severity of Issue:</u> Medium - an attacker could send non-stop curl requests which would take up all the space in the server. With countless posts to the home page, the “Passenger List” would just be filled with never-ending, meaningless requests making the page ugly to the user. I think this is medium intensity, though, because it is isn’t possibly taking anyone’s private information and can be removed on the server.</li>

				<li><u>Description of Issue:</u> I noticed that Kinglsey didn't check for how many post requests have been made. <img src="images/database_space2" alt="kingsley's code">The database will keep filling up since rate limiting doesn’t exist. There was no point at which it terminated after a certain number of post requests. Through filling up the database, I also broke the way that the front end rendered. The requests were no longer in order. I posted the username “hey….y” with an extra ‘y’ every time so that it wouldn’t just replace the previous “hey”.</li>

				<li><u>Proof of Vulnerability:</u> <img src="images/database_space1" alt="joke page"></li>

				<li><u>Resolution:</u> He could use rate limiting which could be thought of as: per user access token. If a method allows for 15 requests per rate limit window, then it allows 15 requests per window per access token. This idea could be used to control the rate of traffic sent to his server.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3><b>Issue 3</b></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Issue:</u> Invalid data was still accepted for latitude and longitude. </li>

				<li><u>Location:</u> Kingsley’s index.js from assignment 2</li>

				<li><u>Severity of Issue:</u> Medium - In assignment 3, he didn’t check the limits of the latitude and longitude received, so any number was accepted as valid input; however, the range of latitude is 0 to +/- 90 and range of longitude if 0 to +/- 180. I was able to break the front end by sending junk data (800000, 800000) through his database and into his app; however it doesn’t create any privacy issues which is why I chose medium. <img src="images/bounds3" alt="kingsley's code"></li>

				<li><u>Description of Issue:</u> When that input is taken and sent to the client side (in assignment 2), the map doesn’t know how to render the point and thus has an internal Google Maps API warning: SensorNotRequired, which isn’t there when given a normal latitude and longitude. (show pic)</li>

				<li><u>Proof of Vulnerability:</u> <img src="images/bounds1" alt="passenger list">
				<img src="images/bounds2" alt="map unrendered"></li>

				<li><u>Resolution:</u> In his app.post in assignment 3, he should check that the latitude and longitude are within range with a simple if/else statement, and report an error if over or under the bounds.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<hr><h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Never ever trust user input! For Kingsley, I think it would be beneficial to do more checking and parsing of user input. One, check the username and make sure there is no cross-site scripting. Two, check the bounds of the latitude and longitude to make sure they are real points in the world. Three, make sure there is a limit as to how many requests can be made to the database (through time or number of attempts).</p>
